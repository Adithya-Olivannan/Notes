# Notes
This repo contains notes that I took while in Sprypoint

## How you should add your own notes
1. Make sure you aren't adding repetitive notes.
2. Good naming convention, please.
3. Place notes under the correct directory. If you want to add notes about Play, put it under Play-Notes
4. Extension should be .md
5. Good formatting of notes. Use hashtags for headings and put code inside code blocks
